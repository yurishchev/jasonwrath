"Just Another Social Network Without Real And True Hypothesis" (In fact this project will change the world)

We will start creating basic social functionalities which will later incarnate to domain-specific awesome realization. We will apply best design decisions and gamification techniques to make the project really useful and attractive to our users. But it's in future - now we'll concentrate on expressing the Wrath of Jason. ;-)

Technically project will be a web app implemented in AngularJS (UI) using REST calls (server). REST calls and server engine implementation is a subject for discussion. Originally we'll try to use Play Framework.
